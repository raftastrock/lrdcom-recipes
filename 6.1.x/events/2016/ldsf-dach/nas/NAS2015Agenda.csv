As such, sites should have aggressive goals for both actual and user perceived latency. The most obvious metric is load time, also websites often optimize and minify resources, however, even with cached resources the browser still has to re-parse and execute the CSS and JS on every page load, it still has to lay out the HTML and redraw the UI. This slows down the actual navigation but can also add perceived slowness and often introduces a white flash. In order to improve actual and perceived latencies many sites are moving to the Single Page Application (SPA) model. These days the approach is widely employed by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and Flickr. These examples all feel kind of app-y.

In fact, a 2015 survey shows that 38% of adults rated communication providers’ customer service, in general, as the worst in America. With a vision to transform their customer’s experience, Enventis set course to be the communications provider that customers want to do business with. Enventis envisioned a world-class customer engagement platform for their commercial customers.

Choosing Liferay, Enventis set out to create an Account Center where information would be integrated and related from a wide variety of systems into an exceptional customer experience that provided personalized interactions based on the unique mix of products and services each customer deployed. The desire was to transform the way business customers could interact with Enventis, consuming their account information when they desired, with greater flexibility to manage their business.

Then, before the project even started, Consolidated Communications, Inc. merged with Enventis. While leadership of the combined organization remained committed to moving the project forward, the tasks of user experience, architecture, integration, and development were now required to span two unique enterprise ecologies.

In this talk we’ll share lessons learned using Liferay to integrate two companies’ diverse systems, data, and cultures and, most importantly, how Consolidated Communications, Inc. is fulfilling their vision to become the communications provider that customers want to do business with.",,Indiana,,,/documents/14/64021955/CCI+and+sdg+100+Passwords+Presentation.pdf/c8fda41d-15c8-40b9-bef9-0b5eb463e233,,64279206,/documents/47511614/63887359/100+Passwords+Transforming+What+Customers+Hate+Into+an+Exceptional+Customer+Experience_Charlene+Williams+%26+Graham+Francois.mp3/dab82930-b1d0-4083-bb6d-aa8f5b90ea37,true,true,,Case Study,false

It provides access to HP product and marketing information, pricing and quoting tools, funding and rewards and the direct HP support and services partners need to be able to serve their customers. In early 2013, partner feedback combined with poor competitive ranking, made it abundantly clear that the existing partner portal was delivering a poor quality partner experience and the ten-year old technology needed to be replaced.

The subsequent transformation program has resulted in a dramatic 220% jump in partner satisfaction with the new state-of-the art partner portal which utilizes every element of the Liferay platform to its full capability. Designed and developed in just 11 months, the new HP Partner Portal deployed to approximately 650,000 HP partner users in 174 countries in just 13 months, and enables $24M of channel revenue an hour, $700K a minute globally. The dynamic content facilitated by Liferay has meant that, for the first time in company history, all HP business groups and all HP partners are able to leverage one partner portal via a single URL at partner.hp.com to access the tools and content they need to do business with HP.

This presentation describes the HP partner portal transformation program and explains how the single portal built on Liferay paves the way for company separation on November 1, 2015, with the evolution of the original portal into two separate partner portals for Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.",,Chicago Ballroom (E-H),H9xtSO-6aXY,,/documents/14/64021955/2015+LRNAS_HP+Portal+Revolution_Anne+Anderson_Keynote_Final.pdf/1f0e6576-79ae-4375-b768-09e4f13b6419,,63951440,,true,true,,Case Study,false
