                Liferay. Here are a few ideas to help you get started: omnichannel, digital touchpoints, IoT, new features,
                best practices for Liferay architecture, backend and frontend infrastructure, mobility, developer tooling,
                identity management and administration, and support for extensions and integrations through the Liferay Marketplace.</li>

                <strong>Connected Technologies</strong>: These topics focus on mission critical applications used in conjunction
                with Liferay, such as support for dynamic languages and frameworks, DevOps tooling (Docker, Puppet), cloud
                deployments & infrastructure (Azure, AWS), security best practices, and dealing with data.</li>
